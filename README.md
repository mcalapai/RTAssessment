# Job Matching Recommendation Algorithm

## Project Structure

The `/data` folder includes the provided CSV files, as well as larger generated datasets for testing purposes. The `/out` folder contains a CSV file with the final job match recommendations.

## Installing requirements

Clone the package to your local machine. Then cd into the directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The code is found inside the `solution.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

## Task

The task is to develop job matching recommendation algorithm that matches jobseekers to jobs based on the skills required. Each row of the `jobseekers.csv` file represents a job seeker and lists their skills, and each row of the `jobs.csv` file represents a job and the skills required.
